## Planning the Project

One day I was thinking about making a project to add to my resume and randomly went on YouTube, discovering a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlpIojusBE) that I enjoyed a lot, creating Christmas Tree lights that were able to be mapped in 3d space. I was astonished by the work put in as well as the final product. With Christmas coming up, I knew I wanted to do this project and add a little twist. All that I needed to do was to order the parts and then work as hard as I could to complete this project on time. Spoilers... I didn't finish it on time. This blog is the story of that project, what the final result was, and what I plan to add to it in the future.

I'm not very knowledgeable with electronics in general, so when I was going through this project, I learned various things such as soldering and wiring. When ordering the controller for the program I needed it to be small and compact, but yet powerful for it's size. I went through many different processors, but I landed on the [Seeed ESP32 C-3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html). It had fitted all of my criteria, and had WiFi. It was WiFi from the board that inspired my twist on the original project in the first place. 

The "twist" I keep mentioning was to create a 3D mappable led tree BUT make a website that a user can interact with to control the LEDs with over the internet. This blog references the experience and process that happened while making this project, which is still not complete due to a lack of time.
