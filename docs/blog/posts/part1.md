# Starting Out

I was seriously considering how I wanted to create my website. At this point I was fairly new to website design, but I wanted to experiment with something other than react js.

I ended up landing on Next and created the boilerplate they dictate on their tutorial. I wanted to start right away, but ended up waiting for the materials to come in and my life to get a bit less busy than I was.

## The Realization

Because I didn't start right away, I was able to plan a bit more about the structure of my code, however wasn't able to land on anything just yet, or at least until I started to code the functions of the controller. However I realized that I wouldn't have much time (maybe a few weeks to finish everything, with something that I don't have much to any experience with).

Sadly I wan't able to complete everything, but maybe if I had given myself a bit more time and planned out my code more I would have been able to complete the project by the deadline.
