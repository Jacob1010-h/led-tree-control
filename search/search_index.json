I was astonished by the work put in as well as the final product. With Christmas coming up, I knew I wanted to do this project and add a little twist. All that I needed to do was to order the parts and then work as hard as I could to complete this project on time. Spoilers... I didn't finish it on time. This blog is the story of that project, what the final result was, and what I plan to add to it in the future.</p> <p>I'm not very knowledgeable with electronics in general, so when I was going through this project, I learned various things such as soldering and wiring. When ordering the controller for the program I needed it to be small and compact, but yet powerful for it's size. I went through many different processors, but I landed on the Seeed ESP32 C-3. It had fitted all of my criteria, and had WiFi. It was WiFi from the board that inspired my twist on the original project in the first place.</p> <p>The \"twist\" I keep mentioning was to create a 3D mappable led tree BUT make a website that a user can interact with to control the LEDs with over the internet. This blog references the experience and process that happened while making this project, which is still not complete due to a lack of time.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/11/11/starting-out/","title":"Starting Out","text":"<p>I was seriously considering how I wanted to create my website.

Looking back on it I really would've liked to just make a GET request to a website to get the LED's desired color (which is what i eventually did)... but I guess thats what I get for not planning out a project enough.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/14/microdot-is-not-the-way/","title":"Microdot is not the way","text":"<p>I was debating on how to control the LEDs over wifi for some time, I first tried to use Microdot, and that worked great, however, it wasn't the user experience that I was looking for.
